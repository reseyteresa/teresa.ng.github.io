This paper investigates whether recreational cannabis acts as a substitute or complement for opioids in the United States. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework, the study examines changes in opioid prescription demand following the legalization of recreational cannabis across selected U.S. states.

The results indicate that recreational cannabis legalization is associated with a statistically significant reduction in opioid prescriptions once state fixed effects and income controls are included, supporting the substitution hypothesis. However, an extended analysis suggests that overall drug overdose rates increase post-legalization, highlighting a potential policy trade-off. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on cannabis legalization, opioid harm reduction, and unintended public health consequences.
