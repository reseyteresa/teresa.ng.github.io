This paper analyzes Thailand’s long-run economic growth trajectory using a growth accounting and growth diagnostics framework. Drawing on historical, macroeconomic, and sectoral data, the study reviews Thailand’s growth performance over the past 25 years, focusing on GDP growth, poverty reduction, income inequality, and structural transformation.

Using a Solow–Swan growth accounting approach, the results show that total factor productivity (TFP) plays a central role in explaining Thailand’s growth fluctuations, particularly during periods of rapid expansion and post-crisis recovery. Despite declining poverty rates, income inequality remains high relative to regional peers. A growth diagnostics analysis identifies key binding constraints to sustained growth, including weak innovation capacity, skills mismatches in the labor market, financial frictions faced by SMEs, and demographic pressures from an ageing population. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at promoting inclusive, productivity-driven growth and supporting Thailand’s transition toward high-income status.
