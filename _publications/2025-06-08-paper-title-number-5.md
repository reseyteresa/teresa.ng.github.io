This paper studies how message framing influences charitable donation behavior through the lens of behavioral economics. Using a survey-based experimental design, the study tests three framing mechanisms—self-interest motivation, social identity framing, and word length—to examine their effects on donation amounts and recurring donation behavior.

Based on responses from over 300 participants, the results show that social identity framing and gender significantly influence donation outcomes, while self-interest framing, word length, and religion do not yield statistically significant effects. In particular, messages that foster a sense of group belonging increase donation amounts, and female respondents are more likely to engage in longer recurring donations. The findings highlight the importance of psychological framing and identity-based appeals in effective charity outreach, with implications for nonprofit communication strategies and fundraising design. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
