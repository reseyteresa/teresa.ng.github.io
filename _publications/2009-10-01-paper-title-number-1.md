excerpt: 'This paper examines the impact of U.S. trade tariff shocks under Sections 201, 232, and 301 on both targeted and non-targeted economies using a Bayesian hierarchical Panel VAR-X model. By allowing for country-specific responses and modeling tariff severity and exposure, the analysis separates direct effects from indirect spillovers across countries. The results show that China experiences significant and persistent declines in real exports following U.S. tariff shocks, while effects on other countries are largely insignificant. Scenario-based forecasts suggest that continued or intensified tariffs would lead to prolonged adverse impacts on China’s export performance.'
