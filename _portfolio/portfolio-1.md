During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was happy to be part of the **Milksha Singapore** team that participated in a public initiative to distribute **free naturally derived disinfectant hand sanitizer** to customers. This initiative was reported by *8days.sg* and aimed to support public hygiene efforts during a period of heightened uncertainty and health risk.

As a frontline staff member, I directly assisted in the **distribution of hand sanitizers** at the store, interacting with customers and helping ensure the smooth execution of the giveaway. While the initiative itself was organised at the company level, my role involved on-the-ground participation and customer engagement during a critical phase of the pandemic.
