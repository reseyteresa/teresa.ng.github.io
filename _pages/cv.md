Working Papers
==============

* **The Impact of Recreational Cannabis Legalization on Opioid Demand**  
  *Master’s Empirical Industrial Organization Course, Singapore Management University*  
  Ng, T. (2025).  
  * Investigates whether recreational cannabis legalization reduces prescription opioid demand across U.S. states.
  * Applies a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design comparing treated states (e.g. California, Maine) to matched controls.
  * Controls for inflation and median income to strengthen causal identification.
  * Finds preliminary evidence of a substitution effect in selected states.  
  *Under review at Taylor & Francis (editorial stage).*

* **How Does the Complexity of Housing Policy Affect Its Acceptance in Singapore?**  
  *Master’s Data Sampling Course, Singapore Management University*  
  Ng, T., Li, W., Yip, R., Nopany, A., & Ye, S. (2025).  
  * Examines how policy complexity affects public understanding, affordability perceptions, and housing decisions.
  * Combines heuristic usability testing of HDB’s website with a stratified in-person survey (n = 149).
  * Finds that policy complexity delays or discourages BTO applications for 20–30% of respondents.
  * Demonstrates framing effects through simplified policy explanations.

* **Growth Analysis of Siam – Thailand**  
  *Master’s Economics of Poverty and Growth Course, Singapore Management University*  
  Ng, T. (2025).  
  * Conducts Solow–Swan growth accounting using Penn World Table data (1990–2019).
  * Identifies binding constraints using the Hausmann–Rodrik–Velasco framework.
  * Highlights TFP as a key driver alongside persistent structural challenges.
  * Proposes policy reforms to address middle-income trap dynamics.

* **Beyond Dollars and Cents: The Impact of Framing on Charitable Giving**  
  *Master’s Statistics Course, Singapore Management University*  
  Ng, T. (2024).  
  * Studies how framing influences donation behavior using field survey data.
  * Leads experimental design, data collection, and regression analysis.
  * Identifies statistically significant framing effects on giving behavior.

* **Understanding the Impact of U.S. Trade Policy Shocks on Direct and Indirectly Affected Economies:  
  A Bayesian Hierarchical Panel VAR-X Approach**  
  *Master’s Thesis (Capstone), Singapore Management University*  
  Research under the guidance of Dr. Anthony Tay  
  Ng, T. (2025).  
  * Analyzes the macroeconomic effects of U.S. tariff shocks (Sections 201, 232, 301) on eight countries using monthly panel data (2010–2022).
  * Employs a Bayesian Panel VAR-X model with hierarchical priors and partial pooling.
  * Models both direct and indirect effects using binary and severity-weighted tariff shocks.
  * Finds significant negative effects for China, with limited evidence for spillovers to other countries.
